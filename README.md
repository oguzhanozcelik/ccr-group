# CCR Group NodeJS

## Postman Collection
You can easily find the routes in the project and also I added New Collection.postman_collection.json to the project to import to postman


When launching for the first time;
```bash
node app.js
```
###or
# Nodemon Installation
Either through cloning with git or by using [npm](http://npmjs.org) (the recommended way):

```bash
npm install -g nodemon # or using yarn: yarn global add nodemon
```
# Usage

nodemon wraps your application, so you can pass all the arguments you would normally pass to your app:

```bash
nodemon app.js
```
